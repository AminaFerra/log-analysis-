===== ðŸ§  SUGGESTIONS =====
1. Reduce 4xx/5xx errors by improving input validation and server stability.
2. Investigate failure spikes on top failure hours and days.
3. Monitor IPs with unusually high GET/POST activity for potential abuse.
4. Use rate limiting for IPs making excessive requests.
5. Consider improving caching or load balancing if many 500 errors appear during peak hours.
